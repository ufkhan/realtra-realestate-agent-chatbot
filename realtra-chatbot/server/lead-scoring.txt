## 🔢 Lead Scoring Criteria

### 🧠 Explicit Criteria (from answers)
Buyer:
- Timeline (sooner = hotter)
- Budget (higher = more qualified)
- Financing (pre-approved/cash = strong)
- Motivation (e.g. relocation = serious)

Seller:
- Timeline (sooner = hotter)
- Property condition (good/excellent = easier sale)
- Price expectation (realistic = better)
- Mortgage status (low/no mortgage = smoother close)

### 📈 Behavioral Criteria (from stepsLog)

- answered rate (skipping questions = lower quality)
- Message clarity (future: via sentiment or token count)
- Engagement level (e.g. detailed answers, questions asked)
