## üî¢ Lead Scoring Criteria

### üß† Explicit Criteria (from answers)
Buyer:
- Timeline (sooner = hotter)
- Budget (higher = more qualified)
- Financing (pre-approved/cash = strong)
- Motivation (e.g. relocation = serious)

Seller:
- Timeline (sooner = hotter)
- Property condition (good/excellent = easier sale)
- Price expectation (realistic = better)
- Mortgage status (low/no mortgage = smoother close)




5 Tier Approach to Score Leads

---- Tier 1: Form Completion ----

  - Simply ensure that the user has completed the form. if so +50. otherwise 0.


---- Tier 2: Preparedness ---- 
  - amount of unprovided answers 

---- Tier 3: Reasonability of Answers ----

  - Go through each answer for each question individually and make sure reasonable. (eg: Budget is not 1 trillion USD, location is not Antarctica, type of house is not a treehouse, etc)
  - Go through possible combinations and make sure reasonable. (eg: location + type of house + # bedrooms matches budget)
  - GPT can then give a score between 1 to 100 of reasonability

---- Tier 4: General Lead Temp Gauges ----
  - Go through answers which can have an actual impact on a lead being colder or warmer (eg: looking to buy/sell ASAP, higher budget = warmer lead, payment in cash better, etc)
      - Add scores based on each answers (discuss with gpt about appropriate numbers)
  - Paste entire convo [question: answer] to GPT and ask for its evaluation of 
      - Tone (friendly, angry, excited, urgent, laid back, nonchalant, etc), Detail of Answers and thought put in answers, 
        Consistency of answers (are there contradictions? contradictions = minus points)
      - GPT can give a confidence level score for this section
  - GPT then returns final score for this Tier

---- Tier 5: Client Preferences ----
  - Adjust score for this tier according to specific client preferences. (if client prefers location x only and this lead matches that then add to score for this lead, etc)


At end, GPT can calcualte and give a final score while giving an explanation and summary of why it gave that score summarizing its findings from the above tiers
